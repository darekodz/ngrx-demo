# Ngrx Demo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0. It is using NgRx to show how easy can be passing data between components. In this basic project we have 2 components which use actions to update the store. In the third component we use a selector to show the current list of items (in this case links). You can use Redux DevTool to see the whole flow of the app.
Download it and install or enjoy the version hosted [here](https://darekodz.github.io/ngrx-demo/) 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
